## Google App Scripts


## 2. ShotGrid scripts 
### Speeding up the Production workflow
These scripts use the official Python-based API, maintained by ShotGrid Software. I use this collection of scripts to boost the ShotGrid project's setup. Here, you can also find some notes and tips I learned. 

## 3. Rigging scripts 
### Speeding up the Rigging process
These Python 3 anmd MEL scripts reduce the number of repetitive tasks, like creating a control or connecting nodes.
