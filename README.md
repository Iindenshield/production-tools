# "Space Capades" optimization
### A graduation animated mock-commercial (it's long)
Some scripts to optimize the animation pipeline.

**_Disclaimer: These are STUDY NOTES. Please, if you have suggestions feel free to comment. Anyway, thanks for checking out my repository_**

## Structure
The scripts divide into two main groups:
1. ShotGrid (ex-Shotgun) scripts
2. Rigging scripts

### 1. ShotGrid scripts 
#### Speeding up the Production workflow
These scripts use the official Python-based API, maintained by ShotGrid Software. I use this collection of scripts to boost the ShotGrid project's setup. Here, you can also find some notes and tips I learned. 

### 2. Rigging scripts 
#### Speeding up the Rigging process
These Python 3 anmd MEL scripts reduce the number of repetitive tasks, like creating a control or connecting nodes.
