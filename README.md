# "Space Capades" optimization
### An animated mock-commercial graduation short film (it's long)
Some scripts to get the short-movie pipeline optimized.

## Structure
The scripts divide into two main groups:
1. ShotGrid scripts
2. Rigging scripts

### 1. Shotgun scripts 
#### Speeding up the Production workflow
These scripts use the official Python-based API, maintained by ShotGrid Software. It is a collection of Python scripts reducing the number of repetitive tasks.

### 2. Rigging scripts 
#### Speeding up the Rigging process
These scripts avoid repetitive tasks, like creating a control or connecting nodes.
